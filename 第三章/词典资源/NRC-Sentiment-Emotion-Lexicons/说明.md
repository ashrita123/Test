*The Sentiment and Emotion Lexicons* is a collection of lexicons that was entirely created by the experts of the National Research Council of Canada. Developed with a wide range of applications, this lexicon collection can be used in a multitude of contexts such as sentiment analysis, product marketing, consumer behaviour and even political campaign analysis.

The technology uses a list of words that help identify emotions, sentiment, as well as analyzing hashtags, emoticons and word-colour associations. The lexicons contain entries for English words, and can be used to analyze English texts. For some lexicons, also provided are translations of the entries in other languages, including French, Arabic, Chinese, and Spanish.

Each of the lexicons is available in a sub-folder corresponding to its name. Further details about these lexicons are available in the READMEs provided within each sub-folder and in the associated papers listed in the READMEs.
